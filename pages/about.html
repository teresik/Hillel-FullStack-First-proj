        <h2 class="texth">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
        <pre class="textpre">
                <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
            1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
            recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
            Lorem Ipsum.&copy;</pre>

        <h2 class="texth">Why do we use it?</h2>
        <pre class="textpre">
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
            content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
            that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
            'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
            publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
            text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
            infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
            sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).&copy;</pre>

        <p class="textp">You can find Lorem Ipsum on this <a href="loremipsum.html">link</a></p>
